# RockPaperScissors
The Odin Project - Foundations Project

Goal 1:
Create a game of rock paper scissors in the console with Javascript using techniques learned thus far

What I learned:
- The importance of pseudocode to sketch logical framework, "living to code another day", and refactoring code for more efficient solutions.
- calling a random array index
- using prompt(), logical AND, OR operators, and template literals
- creating and calling functions
- using Git to add, commit, and push changes to GitHub

Goal 2:
Use a git branch to create buttons for the player selection and display results in the DOM.  Winner is first to 5 points

What I learned:
- using git branch to work on changes and merging to git main
- use DOM manipulation in JavaScript with functions like querySelector and addEventListener
- the usefulness of console.log to display how the program is operating
