# RockPaperScissors
The Odin Project - Foundations Project

Goal 1:
Create a game of rock paper scissors in the console with Javascript using techniques learned thus far

What I learned:
- The importance of pseudocode to sketch logical framework, "living to code another day", and refactoring code for more efficient solutions.
- calling a random array index
- using prompt(), logical AND, OR operators, and template literals
- creating and calling functions
- using Git to add, commit, and push changes to GitHub
